# Incident and Problem Management 

Use the procedures described in this section to implement the appropriate processes for managing Azure service incidents and technical problems related to Azure. Once these processes are in place, your Monitoring, Incident and Service Desk teams will be equipped to manage planned and unplanned outages/changes to services that rely upon Azure. 
 
## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

1. Create an Azure Major Incident Response Plan: Major Incident Response Plan 
2. Create (or update) a Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan: Security Incident Response Plan 
3. Configure/subscribe to Azure service health alerts via the following avenues: 
 - RECOMMENDED - Activity Log alerts:  Create activity log alerts on service notifications 
 - OPTIONAL (if you leverage a 3rd-party Operations Platform) - Webhook integration: Configure health notifications for existing problem management systems using a webhook 
 - OPTIONAL (if you leverage a 3rd-party ITSM tool) - ITSM Connector for Azure: Connect Azure to ITSM tools using IT Service Management Connector 
 - OPTIONAL (if you require a more programmatic approach beyond Activity Log alerts) - ARM templates & PowerShell: Set up Azure Service Health Alerts programmatically using PowerShell 
 - OPTIONAL (if you require an RSS feed) - Azure Status webpage RSS: Azure Status RSS 
4. If you have a Microsoft Premier Support contract: 
 - Ensure your Azure subscriptions are enabled for Premier Support: Reach out to your Microsoft Technical Account Manager 
 - Ensure appropriate staff members are enabled to log Premier Support cases: Reach out to your Microsoft Technical Account Manager 
5. On an ongoing basis, monitor Azure health status via the avenues outlined above in Step 3. 

## Procedure - How to Manage Azure Service Incidents and Problems 

Use this procedure to manage Azure Service Incidents and Azure-related technical problems that impact or may impact your organization. 

1. Create Incident in your internal Incident Management System 
 - Specifically for issues that are relevant to the Azure services you leverage - Not for every Azure service incident that Microsoft publishes 
 - Webhook integration or ITSM Connector for Azure may allow for Azure service health alerts to automatically create a new incident in your Incident Management / ITSM system 
 - May also create new incident in your internal Incident Management System for issues discovered by users or service desk or IT/Ops, that are not yet confirmed by Microsoft to be Azure service incidents 

2. Collaborate with Microsoft Support 
 - Create Support ticket with Microsoft: How to create an Azure support request 
  - Note: Premier customers should select 'Premier' as the Support Plan 

3. Update Incident status in your internal Incident Management System 
 - On an as needed basis, monitor Azure health status via the avenues outlined in the 'Preparation' section 
 - Webhook integration or ITSM Connector for Azure may allow for Azure service health alerts to automatically update existing incident in your Incident Management / ITSM system 
 - Upon issue resolution, close incident in your internal Incident Management System 

4. If the issue was rooted in Azure, complete Post-Incident Steps 
 - If you require root-cause details of the Azure Service Incident, obtain the Post-Incident Report: Incident Follow-Up 
 - If the issue impacted your Business and violated the SLA of the particular Azure Service, submit a service credit request: Incident Follow-Up 

## Next Steps 

After you implement the Incident and Problem Management processes, incorporate any new learnings into existing knowledge: Knowledge Management
